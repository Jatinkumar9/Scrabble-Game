## What's new:
The purpose of this milestone was to have additional features to the game. An "AI" player is also implemented where any player in the game can be assigned to be an "AI" player. The calculation of score is done by using placement of letters, blank tiles, premium squares. The players can also undo/redo their moves and can save/load the game.


## Known issues for Milestone 4
1. The AI player cannot make first move
2. The letter cannot be reshuffled

## Feedback implemented from Milestone 3
1. AI player implemented
2. Additional features: blank tiles, premium squares, and the ability to use any number of “AI” players
3. Fixed implementation of the game from first milestones

# Roadmap Ahead
