# SYSC3110_Project
Scrcabble Game
This is the implementation of Scrabble: Milestone 3. The work is done after splitting from the former group and Jatin Kumar is the only contributor to this milestone. As per the TAs feedback it was required to create a GitHub fork from the previous group submissions, but it was not possible as the members made their GitHub repository private. So, here is the new repository.

Following are the highlights of work done;
Implementation of feedback from previous milestone: The BoardFrame was showing invalid word error even if the word is valid in the resource file. This FileNotFoundException Error was fixed.
Created missing requirements and progressed them further on the milestone 3: The testing with Junit and documentation along with UML sequence diagrams were implemented for this milestone.
Implementation of AI Player: AI player logic is implemented where it checks for number assigned to the player and if the assigned is 0/Null the AI Player plays the game itself.
Code Clean up: Some portions of the code were unclear/smelly, they have been cleaned to make it look tidy.

I apologize, some features could not be implemented as the group issues only got concluded in the middle of week and then further got occupied with the lab exam this week.

Way Forward: On receiving the TAs feedback Milestone 4 features will be added to the final version game.
